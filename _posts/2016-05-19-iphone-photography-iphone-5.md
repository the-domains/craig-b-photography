description: "The iPhone 5 was my camera, and phone, for the better part of two years (thank God for AppleCare Plus, for sure. I destroyed two of 'em in 23 months, with my final replacement coming on the last day of coverage- $99/replacement aint half bad!) I put it on par with my Dad's Retina IIIc; a good daily shooter with nice character- plus it fits in your pocket. My other daily shooter is a Sony Alpha NEX 5T, but those pics are another story. Anyway, I've finally moved up to an iPhone 6s Plus after giving my Mom my almost brand-new iPhone 5. The new phone is almost too good, if that's a thing- I guess I'll test that over a couple of years and see what I get."
